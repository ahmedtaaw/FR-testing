The Feed Reader testing
===============================
a feed reader app, uses Fead reader test cases to make sure of:
-check if all feeds are defined
-check if URL in each feed are defined and not empty
-check if name in each feed are defined and not empty
-check if Menu is hidden by default
-check if Menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked
-should be at least one feed
-check if content changes when a new feed is loaded

How To Run?
================================
you will need "feedreader.js" the spec file that Jasmine will read and contains all of the tests that will be run against your application.
